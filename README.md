This is a personal project written with Python and C++ implementations. It was created for productivity, fun and learning.
At the moment, it contains a library for statistical computation of central tendencies. More functions will be added with time.

Feel free to test, alongside Python Numpy for speed and accuracy. You can also make use of it in your projects and have fun.
