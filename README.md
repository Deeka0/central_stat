This is a personal project created for productivity, fun and learning with Python and C++ implementations respectively.
At the moment, it contains a library for statistical computation of central tendencies. More functions will be added with time.

Feel free to test alongside Python Numpy for speed and accuracy. You can also make use of it in your projects. Voila.
