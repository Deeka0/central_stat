This is a personal project created for productivity, fun and learning with Python and C++ implementations respectively.
For now, this module only features statistical computations for central tendencies. More functions will be added with time.

Feel free to test alongside Python Numpy and Statistics module for speed and accuracy.
<i>Voilà.</i>
